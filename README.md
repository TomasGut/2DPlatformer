## Project installation

Once the project is downloaded, open it through the Unity Hub by clicking Add > Add project from disk, navigating to the project folder, and press open.

## Installing the build

Go to the project folder, the build is located in the WindowsBuild folder (You can move the folder wherever you want), then just open the 2DPlatformerPrototype application.

## Development information

I've tried to set up the project so that it can be expanded/improved quickly, with the basic managers ready to go.
I didn't encounter any problems during development.
